**Srikant Pal - Data Analysis Portfolio**

**About**

Hi, i am Srikant! a data enthusiast learning through real world projects.
This repo reflects my journey toward a career data/business analysis.
Each project here focuses on solving business problems using data,with tools like Python,SQL,Power BI.

**Portfolio Projects**

Below are some of the data analytics projects i have worked on,showcasing my skills in Python,Pandas,SQL,DataVisualization,Power BI and problem solving through data.

### 1.Design Analysis (Apparel Retail Company)

**Goal** : The goal is to analyze the upcoming trends and identify which product features customers value the most.The aim is to support decisions on design, inventory, and product development based on these insights.
**Problem Context** : In the fashion industry, customer attraction, retention, and segmentation are key to business growth. If a company is not aligned with customer preferences, it risks losing revenue. Snitch wants to understand:
1. Which features are trending (e.g., full sleeve shirts, 100% cotton),
2. What customers love and are most likely to buy, and
3. What to stock and restock to avoid lost sales.

Understanding top features by clothing category helps the company to make better product and marketing decisions.

**Description** : The dataset is all about the monthly sales of each products based on different features. When i say features it means the FIT,MATERIAL,SLEEVE_TYPE,COLOR
etc of the products. In this dataset i have one column(categories name), features in different-different columns and month wise sale in separate column.

The project includes the following steps:importing libraries, data loading, data cleaning and preprocessing, filled missing values,EDA (exploratory data analysis),
visualized using bar charts to highlight top performing feature in each category, time series analysis to show upcoming trends,growth and declining product performance,visualization using line graphs to display trends clearly.

**Skills** : Data cleaning, Data analysis,Descriptive analysis,Time Series analysis,Data visualization.

**Technology** : Python,Pandas,Numpy,Seaborn,Matplotlib.

**Insights** : By the help of this analysis the Snitch company will get the idea of upcoming trends that what to produce more in next season,customers likes and dislikes,
top features which customers care more when they buy any products.




### 2.Customer Churn Analysis (telecom dataset)

**Goal** : In any subscription-based business, like telecom companies customer retention is a big challenge.
Customer churn happens when customers or subscribers decides to stop using a service.
I worked on a customer churn analysis project using a telecom dataset. The idea came from the real world problem that telecom companies face - customers switching from one services to other due to better price options,network issues,technical support from companies,dissatisfaction.
So the goal is to analyze the customer behaviour,key factors or metrics that lead to churn.

**Problem Context** : Its very important to understand our customers,their needs,requirements and by doing analysis why customers leave is important because acquiring new customers is costlier than retaining existing one. So if companies can identify the key reasons for churn in advance-- such as pricing,service quality or contract issues,it will help them to retain by giving offers or discounts,improving services.

**Description** : This dataset is all about the unique customers demographic info (like gender,senior citizens status),tenure with the company,type of internet service they use, contract and payment methods, as well as monthly and total charges they have done yet.
The most important column is 'churn' which indicates whether the customer has left the service or not,this is the target variable i aim to analyze.
