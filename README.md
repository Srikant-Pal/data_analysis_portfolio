**About**
Hi, i am Srikant a data enthusiast learning through real world projects.
This repo reflects my journey toward a career data/business analysis.
Each project here focuses on solving business problems using data,with tools like Python,SQL,Power BI.

**Portfolio Projects**
Below are some of the data analytics projects i have worked on,showcasing my skills in Python,Pandas,SQL,DataVisualization,Power BI and problem solving through data.

### 1.Design Analysis (Snitch Retail Company)

**Goal** : The goal is to analyze the upcoming trends and identify which product features customers value the most.The aim is to support decisions on design, inventory, and product development based on these insights.
**Problem Context** : In the fashion industry, customer attraction, retention, and segmentation are key to business growth. If a company is not aligned with customer preferences, it risks losing revenue. Snitch wants to understand:

2. What customers love and are most likely to buy, and
3. What to stock and restock to avoid lost sales.

Understanding top features by clothing category helps the company to make better product and marketing decisions.

etc of the products. In this dataset i have one column(categories name), features in different-different columns and month wise sale in separate column.

The project includes the following steps:importing libraries, data loading, data cleaning and preprocessing, filled missing values,EDA (exploratory data analysis),
visualized using bar charts to highlight top performing feature in each category, time series analysis to show upcoming trends,growth and declining product performance,visualization using line graphs to display trends clearly.

**Skills** : Data cleaning, Data analysis,Descriptive analysis,Time Series analysis,Data visualization.
**Technology** : Python,Pandas,Numpy,Seaborn,Matplotlib.
**Insights** : By the help of this analysis the Snitch company will get the idea of upcoming trends that what to produce more in next season,customers likes and dislikes,
